Requestors raise request for transport arrangements.
Requestors can be Nursing Homes, Public Health Institutes (PHI), other entities, etc.
transport arrangements is sent to TPT planners. transport arrangements can have high priority, e.g. dialysis patients.

Request template:
1. Vehicle type
2. pick up location
3. drop off location
4. scheduled datetime
5. number of patients

TPT planners value-add by including remarks for transport units (e.g. van for wheelchair bound patients)

System will have process - progress view for each transport arrangement case.

Transport unit will indicate arrive, in conveyance, arrived status.


workarounds : group transport units by cluster around geo-spatial towns
good to have: geospatial view of resources on map, nearest resources to attend to cases.

Case to prove:

1. Currently, the request raised goes to the transport planners, and in turn, the planners value
add by including remarks for transport vendors. then the orders for the vendors is sent via Whatsapp.
There is limited tracking available as orders sent via whatsapp is unstructured. And finding information subsequently
in the whatsapp message log is limited only to text search provided by Whatsapp. This is SLOW and not data friendly.

2. Vendors receives payment for providing the transport services. There is a budget secured for the service and it is
very difficult to monitor the utilization of the budget.
